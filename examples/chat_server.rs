//! A show-case of a chat server.
//!
//! The server listens on the port 1234 and accepts connections. Whenever a line of text comes, it
//! is broadcasted to all the clients (including back).
//!
//! There are two long-running coroutines. One accepts the new connections and spawns a receiving
//! coroutine for each. The other is on a receiving end of a channel and broadcasts each message to
//! all the currently available clients. If some of them errors during the send, it is removed.
//!
//! Each receiving coroutine simply reads the lines from the client and stuffs them into the
//! channel.
//!
//! There's a shared `Vec` of new writing halfs of the connections. Before every message, the
//! broadcasting coroutine extracts the new ones and appends them to its local storage (so it
//! doesn't have to keep the shared state borrowed).
//!
//! Currently, there's very little error handling â€’ the relevant connections are simply dropped.
